=head1 Hindi_second_person_honorificity.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In Hindi wuma is always plural. It has wU,wuma,Apa.
On the other hand, Sanskrit has wvam, which is more close to wuma than wU.
So when wvam in Sanskrit which is n singular is mapped to wuma in Hindi which is plural, we need to make the changes in Hindi agreement accordingly.
This module takes care of this divergence.

=head1 EXAMPLES

This is invoked internally within the agreement module
